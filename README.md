# Aarchup

:warning: No longer mantained. See the new one here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aarchup/

aarchup (https://github.com/aericson/aarchup) is a small C application which informs the user when system-updates for Archlinux are available. It's licenced under the GPLv3. In contrast to other update notifiers aarchup is intended to be lightweight and just do what it should: notify about possible updates.
It is forked from Rorschach's archup (http://www.nongnu.org/archup/).

aarchup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It follows the unix-philosophy of "just doing one thing, but doing  it  well". It  can be used to regulary check for new updates and show a desktop notification if there are any.

Read manpages for configuration.
