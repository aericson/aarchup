.SH "NAME"
aarchup \- lightweight pacman update notifier, a fork from archup by Rorschach
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIaarchup\fR [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
aarchup is a small C application which informs the user when system\-updates for Archlinux are available. It's licensed under the GPLv3. In contrast to other update notifiers aarchup is intended to be lightweight and just do what it should, notify about possible updates.

aarchup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It follows the unix-philosophy of "just doing one thing, but doing it well". It notifies about new updates. With a systemd timer aarchup can be used to regularly check for new updates and get a desktop notification if there are some. It can also runs on it's own and check for updates regularly.
.SH "OPTIONS"
          --command|-c [value]        Set the command which gives out the list of updates.
                                      The default is /usr/bin/checkupdates
          --icon|-p [value]           Shows the icon, whose path has been given as value, in the notification.
                                      By default no icon is shown.
          --maxentries|-m [value]     Set the maximum number of packages which shall be displayed in the notification.
                                      The default value is 30.
          --timeout|-t [value]        Set the timeout after which the notification disappears in seconds.
                                      The default value is 3600 seconds, which is 1 hour.
          --uid|-i [value]            Set the uid of the process.
                                      The default is to keep the uid of the user who started aarchup.
                                      !!You should change this if root is executing aarchup!!
          --urgency|-u [value]        Set the libnotify urgency-level. Possible values are: low, normal and critical.
                                      The default value is normal. With changing this value you can change the color of the notification.
          --loop-time|-l [value]      When this is used the program will control the check for updates in the interval of minutes specified,
                                      if none is specified, the default(60) will be used. See: Loop-time above.
          --help                      Prints this help.
          --version                   Shows the version.
          --aur                       Check aur for new packages too. Will need cower installed.
          --debug|-d                  Print debug info.
          --ftimeout [value]          Program will manually enforce timeout for closing notification.
                                      Do NOT use with --timeout, if --timeout works or without --loop-time [value].
                                      The value for this option should be in minutes.
          --pkg-no-ignore             If this flag is set will not use the IgnorePkg variable from pacman.conf. Without the flag will ignore those
                                      packages. Feel free to add packages names to pacman.conf even if they are from AUR, will cause no harm and will
                                      also ignore it and not show updates.



.SH "CONFIGURATION"
aarchup can simply be invoked by executing it from the commandline. But you surely want to automate this task and let aarchup continuously be run with a systemd timer.
There are two ways of automating aarchup runs. One setup is to use the --loop-time option and the other is using a systemd timer.

\fIConfiguration File\fR

You can set up a configuration file instead of passing commandline arguments.
Simply create the file /etc/aarchup.conf
edit it with the following syntax:
.PP
    # Comments are ignored
    # The [main] line defines the group main
    # You need to include this and no arguments
    # can be placed before it.
    # also notice that all options should be in the long form
    # ie: for loop-time use only loop-time do not try to use 'l' or '-l'
    [main]
    # Argument on the left then '=' then the value of it
    # ie:
    loop-time=30
    # Arguments without a value must have the '=' sign
    # ie:
    aur=
.PP
Please notice that if you have the file /etc/aarchup.conf all arguments passed to aarchup will be ignored except --help and --version.

\fILoop-time\fR

When using the --loop-time option the program will run endless. This has an advantage over the systemd method. For example on gnome3 when running aarchup with systemd, if you get more than one notification of updates and you don't close them, they will keep getting stacked and you are going to end up with a few notifications(of the same thing) at the notification bar. Which can get really annoying to close manually.
When the program is running on its own it can keep track of it's notifications and update them as needed instead of creating new ones.
In case you would like to use this method on startup copy /usr/share/doc/aarchup/aarchup.desktop to /home/user/.config/autostart

.PP
         $ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/aarchup/aarchup.desktop /home/user/.config/autostart/
.PP
where user is your username.
Copy the file /usr/share/doc/aarchup/aarchupstartup.example
.PP
         $ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/aarchup/aarchupstartup.example /usr/share/aarchup/aarchupstartup.sh
.PP
Edit the new file with different options if needed. Include --aur if you want to check for updates in AUR(you will need cower installed).

Archup will run on next boot or you can manually start it running /usr/share/aarchup/aarchupstartup.sh


\fIHourly\fR

The most simple setup is for a single user system where you want to check once an hour for updates. In this case just type:
.PP
          $ sudo systemctl start aarchup.timer
.PP
and make it enabled at boot:
.PP
          $ sudo systemctl enable aarchup.timer
.PP 
Now every hour your package database will get updated and after that aarchup will be executed. If there are updates aarchup shows a desktop notification, if there are no updates nothing will happen. The desktop notification will automatically disappear after 60min or if you simply click on it.

\fIother Intervals\fR

If you want to execute aarchup at other intervals than hourly, you can override the settings of the systemd timer unit by either ...
.PP
* Using the \fisystemctl --user edit $UNITNAME\fr command to interactively create an override file for the unit in \fi~/.config/systemd/user/$UNITNAME.d/\fr where $UNITNAME stands for the name of the systemd unit. 

* Or by creating an override file in the aforementioned directory, followed by executing \fisystemctl --user daemon-reload\fr
.PP
After you made the change, you need to restart the unit as well.

Some hints on this:
 * you can adjust the timeout value, before the notification will disappear with the --timeout option of aarchup
