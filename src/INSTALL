We need autoconf,gzip(for zipping the man page) and libevent for building aarchup. At runtime we need pacman and libevent.

Create the configure-script:
        $ autoconf
,execute it
        $ ./configure
compile aarchup
        $ make
and finally install it
        $ make install

this installs the binary to /usr/bin/aarchup and the other files to /usr/share/doc/aarchup and /usr/share/aarchup.

Now read the man page for the configuration.
